# Face Detection Retinaface

### Pretrained Weight for Transfer learning
This Project use `resnet` weight for training. `resnet50`, `resnet152`. Put them into `retinaface/model/`
- ImageNet ResNet50 ([baidu cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1WAkU9ZA_j-OmzO-sdk9whA) and [googledrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ibQOCG4eJyTrlKAJdnioQ3tyGlnbSHjy/view?usp=sharing)).
- ImageNet ResNet152 ([baidu cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1nzQ6CzmdKFzg8bM8ChZFQg) and [googledrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FEjeiIB4u-XBYdASgkyx78pFybrlKUA4/view?usp=sharing)). 

**! These models are not for detection testing/inferencing but training and parameters initialization.**

### Pretrained Weight for TEST
Pretrained Model: `RetinaFace-R50` is a medium size model with ResNet50 backbone.
